I am an assistant professor in cybersecurity at Concordia University in
Montreal at the department of engineering and computer science. My research
centers around program analysis, privacy enhancing technologies, and anonymity
in cryptocurrencies. 

I completed my PhD at the University of Luxembourg in 2015, and before joining
Concordia I was a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Toronto and
at Cornell University. I received my Master's degree in Applied Mathematics and
Computer Science from National Research Nuclear University MEPhI in Moscow,
Russia.

My research follows two main directions.
<!--that fall under the umbrella of cybercrime investigation. -->
First, I try to find novel ways to automatically
and reliably identify exploitable vulnerabilities within large code bases and
binary code. On the other hand, I am interested in devising methods and tools
to deanonymize criminals that use anonymization technologies (e.g. Tor and Cryptocurrencies) to hide their
traces.
